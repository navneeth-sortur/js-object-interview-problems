# 🧠 JavaScript Object Interview Problems

Welcome to the **JavaScript Object Interview Problems** series — a curated collection of **20 hand-picked problems** designed to strengthen your understanding of JavaScript objects through real-world use cases.

Objects are the backbone of JavaScript — everything from APIs, configs, and data structures to classes and prototypes relies on them.  
This repo helps you **practice object manipulation**, learn **key concepts**, and explore **multiple solution approaches** (where applicable) — from straightforward logic to optimized techniques.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Master object creation, cloning, and manipulation
- Learn to handle **nested objects** and **deep operations**
- Practice **sorting, grouping, merging, and transforming** data
- Understand **immutability**, **object equality**, and **safe property access**
- Strengthen your confidence for **interviews** and **real-world development**
